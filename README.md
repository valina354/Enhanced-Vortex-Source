# Enhanced-Vortex

Enhanced Vortex is an improved version of the Source Engine based on Mapbase. It contains new graphical features, enemies, fixes/pull requests from Mapbase/SDK 2013, and more. This codebase was originally made for Half-Life 3: Citadel Unleashed, but anyone can use it due to its cool features.
